This is a full-stack project with a React frontend and Node.js backend.

To run the project, first fork this repository to your GitHub account.

Then clone the forked repo to your local machine.

Install all dependencies by running npm install in both frontend and backend folders.

Open two separate terminals to run the app simultaneously:

In terminal 1, go to the backend folder and run npm start (runs on port 5000).

In terminal 2, go to the frontend folder and run npm start (runs on port 3000).

Make sure both backend and frontend are running at the same time for the app to work properly.
